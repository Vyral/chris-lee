If you’re planning on selling your home in 2019, here are a few things you need to know before you list.

First off, you need to know your buyer. In 2018, we saw that buyers were more restrained and deliberate. **They wanted to look at numbers before they offered full price.&nbsp;**

We also saw that multiple offers were no longer a guarantee, and homes started sitting on the market for a little longer than usual. We also saw that list-to-sale price ratios dropped from 99% to about 96%.

**Where do we sit today as compared to last year?** For one, we have 16% more homes for sale, but we’re still in a seller’s market.&nbsp;

Even though we are in a seller’s market, today’s sellers need a plan. This market is not as forgiving as it has been to overpriced listings. **Not pricing right at the beginning could cost you thousands.**

We have one chance to make a good impression, so your home has to do the best possible job of that. Make sure you declutter, depersonalize, and maximize the space you have.

If you have any questions for me about selling a home or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
